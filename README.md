# ABSTRACT

Installation and configuration of applications on AppStream and stream the applications to the users. Applications can be accessed through HTML 5 browser. The accessing permissions will be controlled. The administrative tasks can be performed in the AppStream console.Applications can be installed using image builder. The provision to an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud(VPC) using a provided AWS Cloud Formation Template. The VPC service will host the AppStream 2.0 resources within the isolated virtual network infrastructure.

# ADVANTAGES
Scalability
It enables you to accommodate larger workloads without disruption of existing infrastructure

# Existing system
The desktop applications can be shared to the browser. This applications will be saved in the server. The assurance of secure usage of applications cannot be given in this system.  

# MODULE SPLITUP
1)Building a desktop application-Gayethiri.R.S
2)2)creating an appstream image-Marry mettilda.S
3)3)Creating network resources-Inba.M
4)4)Testing user experience-done by all

# Future Enhancements
The datas will be more securely shared to browser without any server problems.

The shared applications,datas can be secured in VPC services and will be available.
